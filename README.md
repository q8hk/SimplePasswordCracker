# Password Cracker

This Python project is a simple password cracker that attempts to crack a numerical password of a specified length. It generates all possible combinations of digits and tests them against the target password using a password oracle function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (Tested with Python 3.8)
- Git (optional, for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/q8hk/password-cracker.git
   ```

   Or download the ZIP archive and extract it to your desired location.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd password-cracker
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python password_cracker.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Set the difficulty level by modifying the `difficulty` variable in the `password_cracker.py` file. This determines the number of digits in the target password.

2. Run the script, and it will attempt to crack the password using brute force.

3. The script will display whether it successfully cracked the password or not.
